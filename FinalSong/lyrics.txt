I wanna talk to you baby, but you don't call when he's around
I wanna talk to you baby, but you don't call when he's around
I'm going so crazy, when I wait for a call
Am I old news, do you want me at all?
I wanna talk to you baby, but you don't call when he's around

What your doing to me girl, its drivin me up the wall
What your doing to me girl, its drivin me up the wall
You givin me the slip girl, and you puttin me down
I don't really even know if I want you around, cuz 
What your doing to me girl, its driving me up the wall.

Come on now, come on now, 

Gimmme a break girl, you don't have to be so cruel

I wanna be your man, you gotta be my girl,
but if you be untrue, you know it don't work so

come on now, come on now, 


I wanna talk to you baby, but you don't call when he's around
I wanna talk to you baby, but you don't call when he's around
I'm going so crazy, when I wait for a call
Am I old news, do you want me at all?
I wanna talk to you baby, but you don't call when he's around
